# DiscordMC - Use Discord in Minecraft [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Delta2Force/DiscordMC.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Delta2Force/DiscordMC)

## Installation
Download the latest version from the releases tab and put it in your plugins tab.

## Usage
When the plugin is launched and configured, you have to use /discord. Then you will see a server list.
Just press the button on the server you want to join and there you are.

## Configuration
In the config you will have to enter the bot token of a discord bot. I would've loved to make this something where you can just put your account details in and it worked but that is against the TOS and is a bannable offense. But the bot token in the field for it, reload the server and it should work. Also you will have to manually add the bot to your discord server.
